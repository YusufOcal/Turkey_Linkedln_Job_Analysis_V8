    for col in ['formattedIndustries/0', 'formattedIndustries/1', 'formattedIndustries/2']:
        val = row[col]
        if pd.notna(val) and str(val).strip():
            val_clean = str(val).strip()
            if val_clean not in values:  # Automatic duplicate removal
                values.append(val_clean)
    
    return ' | '.join(values) if values else np.nan
```
